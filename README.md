## Inspiration

I created a simple web app to help people practice job interviews. It's tough to get through interviews, and not everyone knows how to prepare. This tool is for anyone who wants to get better.

## What It Does

The AI Interviewer is a web app where you can practice job interviews. You enter the job you're aiming for, and it gives you a mock interview. Afterward, you get feedback on how you did and what you can improve on.

## Built With

We used Next.js, which is great for building websites, and we styled it with MaterialUI for a nice look. We made the app work smoothly, even though it was hard to get the AI to chat like a real person.
